Predictive maintenance using machine learning

In this project, we are going to build a Predictive Maintenance Model. 
A Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is a cutting-edge approach that leverages data analytics and machine learning to predict when machinery and equipment need maintenance. It is a game-changer in the manufacturing industry, allowing companies to address maintenance issues proactively.

The main reasons for the project include:

âœ“ Cost Reduction: PdM can significantly reduce maintenance costs by allowing Acme to perform maintenance only when needed, avoiding unnecessary downtime and part replacements.
âœ“ Minimize Downtime: By predicting equipment failures in advance, Acme can schedule maintenance during planned downtime, minimizing disruptions to production.
âœ“ Optimized Resource Allocation: PdM enables Acme to allocate maintenance resources efficiently, ensuring that equipment receives the right level of attention at the right time.
âœ“ Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: Meeting production schedules consistently will improve customer satisfaction, leading to customer retention and positive referrals.
âœ“ Employee Safety: PdM reduces the likelihood of sudden equipment failures, enhancing workplace safety for Acme's employees.
